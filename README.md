# **Project 4: ParrotCardGame**

This project was done with the objective to develop a simple memory card game to better capture the new tools seen during the week and try a better code organization.

## **Exercised Contents**:

-    Responsiveness
-    DOM manipulation through vanilla Javascript (querySelector, classList)
-    Javascript methods (setTimeout, setInterval)
-    Handling CSS properties (transform, transition)
-    EventHandlers (onclick)
-    Basic Javascript (functions, do-while, for, Math... ) and best practices

## **Results**:

Applying the pomodoro time management technique I was able to finish the project in a few hours without exceeding my limits. This opened up the possibility for me to review all the code in search of improvement points.

To show the result, the application was posted on [Github Pages](https://migueldsp.github.io/projeto4-parrotcardgame/)! There are desktop and mobile versions.

## **How To Run**:

-    Clone repository
-    Open index.html in your browser

## **Comments**:

With good time management, I did the whole project keeping in mind some practices that I found interesting, such as:

-    Cards with items being generated dynamically, which allowed to reduce repetitive lines of HTML
-    Better organization of functions, with their well-defined and optimized scopes
-    Use of variables in CSS to facilitate future code maintenance
